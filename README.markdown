# DDUnitConverter

A simple library for converting a value from one unit to another.

## Usage

Simply copy the "DDUnitConverter" subfolder into your project, and `#import "DDUnitConversion.h"`.

You can do the actual conversions like so:

```Objective-C
NSNumber *value = [[DDUnitConverter velocityUnitConverter]convertNumber:@100 
															   fromUnit:DDVelocityUnitMilesPerHour 
														         toUnit:DDVelocityUnitFurlongsPerMicrofortnight];
								 
```
## Precision

`DDUnitConverter` does all its transformations using `NSDecimalNumber`, so your precision is limited to anything `NSDecimalNumber` can handle.
												   
## Converters

`DDUnitConverter` has converters for the following categories:

- Acceleration
- Angle
- Area
- Bytes
- Currency (pulls rates from the [International Monetary Fund](http://imf.org))
- Current
- Energy
- Force

- Inductance
- Length
- Magnitude
